AMEN is primarily designed for learning node embeddings in attributed multiplex networks and does not explicitly incorporate a mechanism for detecting subgraph anomalies. However, the learned embeddings may be useful for identifying subgraph anomalies indirectly.

One way to use the learned embeddings for subgraph anomaly detection is to cluster the nodes based on their embeddings and then identify clusters that contain anomalous nodes. Anomalous subgraphs can then be identified as those that contain a high proportion of nodes in anomalous clusters.
Another way to use AMEN for subgraph anomaly detection is to train a classifier on the embeddings that distinguishes between normal and anomalous nodes. This classifier can then be applied to each subgraph in the network, and subgraphs with a high proportion of anomalous nodes can be identified as subgraph anomalies.

Yes, the "Scalable Anomaly Ranking of Attributed Neighborhoods" paper is related to subgraphs, as it focuses on identifying anomalous neighborhoods within a larger network. A neighborhood can be thought of as a subgraph of the larger network that consists of a central node and its neighboring nodes.
The method proposed in the paper computes a neighborhood anomaly score for each node in the network based on its similarity to its neighbors. This score captures the extent to which the node's neighborhood is anomalous compared to the rest of the network. Therefore, the method effectively identifies subgraphs that are anomalous within the larger network.
Moreover, the proposed method can be used to identify anomalous neighborhoods within subgraphs of the larger network. For example, if we have a large social network and we are interested in identifying anomalous neighborhoods within a specific community, we can first extract the subgraph corresponding to that community and then apply the proposed method to identify anomalous neighborhoods within that subgraph.
In summary, the "Scalable Anomaly Ranking of Attributed Neighborhoods" paper is related to subgraphs, as it focuses on identifying anomalous neighborhoods within a larger network, which can be thought of as subgraphs of the larger network.

One potential novel approach for subgraph anomaly detection is to use a graph neural network (GNN) with a self-attention mechanism that can learn to identify and distinguish between normal and anomalous subgraphs.
The first step would be to train the GNN on a large dataset of normal graphs to learn a representation of the typical patterns and structures present in the data. This representation would be learned using a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to selectively attend to different parts of the graph and capture the most relevant information for distinguishing between normal and anomalous subgraphs.
Then, for subgraph anomaly detection, we would extract a subgraph of interest from a new graph and feed it into the pre-trained GNN. The GNN would generate a subgraph representation, which would be compared to the learned representation of normal subgraphs using a distance metric, such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. If the distance is larger than a certain threshold, then the subgraph would be classified as anomalous.
This approach has several advantages. First, it can capture complex patterns and structures that are difficult to represent using traditional statistical methods. Second, it can adapt to new types of anomalies by fine-tuning the pre-trained GNN on a smaller set of anomalous graphs. Finally, it can be easily extended to detect anomalies in larger subgraphs or even entire graphs.

One potential novel approach for subgraph anomaly detection is to use a graph generative model combined with a graph similarity measure.
The idea is to first train a graph generative model on a large dataset of normal graphs, such as a graph autoencoder or a graph variational autoencoder. This model would learn to encode the structure of normal graphs into a latent space representation that captures the typical patterns and structures present in the data.
Then, for subgraph anomaly detection, we would take a new graph and extract a subgraph of interest. We would then generate a set of synthetic graphs from the learned generative model and measure the similarity between the original graph and each synthetic graph using a graph similarity measure, such as graph edit distance or graph kernel similarity.
If the original graph is highly dissimilar to the synthetic graphs generated from the normal graph dataset, this suggests that the subgraph of interest is anomalous and does not fit within the typical patterns and structures learned by the generative model. This approach can be extended to detect anomalies in larger subgraphs or even entire graphs.
This approach has the advantage of being able to detect anomalies that are not easily detectable using traditional statistical methods or rule-based approaches. It is also able to learn from large datasets of normal graphs, making it more robust and adaptive to new types of anomalies.

To evaluate efficiency of the proposed method:
es, that's correct. To compare the performance of the proposed method with baseline methods, we need to use the same evaluation metrics and datasets for all methods. Some examples of baseline methods that can be used for subgraph anomaly detection are:

Clustering-based methods: Clustering-based methods group similar subgraphs together based on a similarity measure and can detect anomalous subgraphs based on their dissimilarity with the rest of the subgraphs. Examples of clustering algorithms include k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.

Classification-based methods: Classification-based methods train a classifier on a set of labeled subgraphs and use it to classify new subgraphs as normal or anomalous. Examples of classification algorithms include decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

Density-based methods: Density-based methods identify clusters of subgraphs based on their density and can detect anomalous subgraphs based on their low density compared to the rest of the subgraphs. Examples of density-based algorithms include LOF (Local Outlier Factor) and DBSCAN.

Graph kernel-based methods: Graph kernel-based methods measure the similarity between subgraphs based on their structural properties and can detect anomalous subgraphs based on their dissimilarity with the rest of the subgraphs. Examples of graph kernel algorithms include the Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel, the shortest path kernel, and the random walk kernel.

Community detection-based methods: Community detection-based methods identify communities or clusters of subgraphs that are more densely connected internally than externally and can detect anomalous subgraphs based on their low degree of association with the rest of the subgraphs. Examples of community detection algorithms include modularity-based methods, spectral clustering, and label propagation.

By comparing the performance of the proposed method with these baseline methods, we can determine whether the proposed method provides a significant improvement over existing approaches for subgraph anomaly detection.

auc-roc
To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method for subgraph anomaly detection, we can use several standard evaluation metrics and compare its performance to baseline methods.
One common metric for evaluating subgraph anomaly detection is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The AUC-ROC measures the trade-off between the true positive rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (1-specificity) across different threshold values. A higher AUC-ROC indicates better performance in distinguishing between normal and anomalous subgraphs.
Another evaluation metric is the precision-recall (PR) curve and its associated AUC-PR metric. The PR curve measures the trade-off between precision and recall across different threshold values. A higher AUC-PR indicates better performance in identifying anomalous subgraphs with high precision.
In addition to these standard metrics, we can also evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method by measuring its computational complexity and running time. This can be done by analyzing the number of parameters and operations required by the model, as well as the time required for training and inference on a given dataset.
To compare the proposed method to baseline methods, we can use traditional statistical methods such as clustering, classification, or density-based approaches, as well as other graph-based methods such as graph kernel methods, graph-based anomaly detection, or community detection methods. We can evaluate the performance of these methods using the same evaluation metrics mentioned above.
Overall, the proposed method should be evaluated based on its ability to accurately detect anomalous subgraphs while also being efficient in terms of computational complexity and running time. Comparing its performance to baseline methods can provide additional insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach

n the above methodology, the input to the GNN is a subgraph of interest extracted from a larger graph. Specifically, given a larger graph, a subgraph of interest is extracted based on certain criteria, such as the presence of specific nodes or edges.


The subgraph is represented using a graph data structure, which consists of two components:


Node features: A matrix of size [num_nodes, num_node_features], where each row represents the feature vector of a node in the subgraph.
Edge indices: A matrix of size [2, num_edges], where each column represents the indices of the two nodes that form an edge in the subgraph.
These node features and edge indices are then fed into the GNN model as input, and the model generates a subgraph representation as output. The subgraph representation is a fixed-size vector that captures the most important features and structural patterns of the subgraph, learned by the GNN through its graph convolutions and self-attention mechanism.

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points or patterns that deviate significantly from the normal behavior or expected patterns. There are several measures that can be used to evaluate the performance of an anomaly detection algorithm, including:

True Positive Rate (TPR): Also known as sensitivity or recall, TPR measures the proportion of actual anomalies that are correctly identified by the algorithm.

False Positive Rate (FPR): FPR measures the proportion of normal data points that are incorrectly identified as anomalies by the algorithm.

Precision: Precision measures the proportion of identified anomalies that are actually true anomalies. It is defined as the ratio of true positives to the total number of positive predictions (i.e., true positives plus false positives).

F1 score: F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall (TPR). It provides a single measure of the trade-off between precision and recall.

Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC): AUC-ROC is a measure of the overall performance of the anomaly detection algorithm. It measures the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot, which shows the trade-off between TPR and FPR for different classification thresholds.

Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR): AUC-PR is a similar measure to AUC-ROC, but it uses the precision-recall curve instead of the ROC curve. It measures the trade-off between precision and recall for different classification thresholds.

Detection time: Detection time measures the time it takes for the algorithm to detect an anomaly after it occurs. This is an important measure for real-time applications where timely detection is critical.

The choice of which measure(s) to use depends on the specific application and the desired trade-offs between different performance metrics.

how to detect anomalies after generating node embeddings
After generating node embeddings using a graph neural network (GNN), there are several approaches that can be used to detect anomalies. Here are some common approaches:

Distance-based methods: One simple approach is to compare the node embeddings of a test graph with the embeddings of a set of known normal graphs. This can be done by computing the distance between the test embeddings and the normal embeddings using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity. If the distance is above a certain threshold, the test graph is classified as anomalous.

Clustering-based methods: Another approach is to cluster the node embeddings of the normal graphs and then use the clustering model to detect anomalies in the test graph. This can be done by assigning the test embeddings to one of the clusters and then computing a score based on the distance between the test embeddings and the centroids of the assigned clusters. If the score is above a certain threshold, the test graph is classified as anomalous.

Reconstruction-based methods: A third approach is to use the node embeddings to reconstruct the graph and then compare the reconstructed graph with the original graph. This can be done by training an autoencoder on the node embeddings of the normal graphs and then using the reconstruction error to detect anomalies in the test graph. If the reconstruction error is above a certain threshold, the test graph is classified as anomalous.

Supervised methods: If labeled data is available, one can train a supervised classification model on the node embeddings to predict whether a graph is normal or anomalous. This can be done using standard machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) or random forests.

The choice of which method to use depends on the specific application and the nature of the data. It is often a good idea to try multiple methods and compare their performance on a validation set before selecting a final approach.

Cluster analysis is a technique used to group similar data points in a dataset. In the context of graph data, cluster analysis can be used to group similar node embeddings in the graph. Once the node embeddings are grouped into clusters, a clustering model can be used to detect anomalies in a test graph. The process involves assigning the node embeddings of the test graph to one of the clusters and computing a score based on the distance between the test embeddings and the centroids of the assigned clusters. If the score is above a certain threshold, the test graph is classified as anomalous.

Here are the steps to follow to apply this technique:

Generate embeddings for the nodes in a set of normal graphs using a suitable node embedding algorithm such as node2vec or GraphSAGE.
Apply a clustering algorithm such as k-means or spectral clustering to the node embeddings to group them into clusters.
Compute the centroid for each cluster by taking the average of the node embeddings in the cluster.
For a test graph, generate node embeddings using the same algorithm as in step 1.
Assign each node embedding in the test graph to one of the clusters based on its proximity to the centroids of the clusters.
Compute a score for the test graph based on the distance between the test embeddings and the centroids of the assigned clusters.
If the score is above a certain threshold, classify the test graph as anomalous.
The choice of clustering algorithm and threshold for anomaly detection would depend on the specific application and the characteristics of the graph data being analyzed.

Two questions:
Test graph will be assigned to different clusters(each node will be similar to a different cluster based on its properties)
Sum of all distances if greater than certain threshold then the given graph is anomalous because it is not similar to the noral nodes





_______________________________________________

To compute a score for the test graph based on the distance between the test embeddings and the centroids of the assigned clusters, we can use a distance metric such as the Euclidean distance or the cosine distance. The score can be computed as follows:

For each node in the test graph, compute its node embedding using the same algorithm as used for the normal graphs.
Assign each node embedding to one of the clusters based on its proximity to the centroids of the clusters.
For each cluster, compute the centroid by taking the average of the node embeddings in the cluster.
For each node embedding in the test graph, compute its distance to the centroid of the assigned cluster using a distance metric such as the Euclidean distance or the cosine distance.
Compute a score for the test graph by taking the maximum distance of any node embedding in the test graph to the centroid of the assigned cluster.
Compare the score to a threshold value. If the score is above the threshold, classify the test graph as anomalous.
The choice of distance metric and threshold value would depend on the specific application and the characteristics of the graph data being analyzed. In general, a larger threshold value would result in fewer false positives but also fewer true positives, while a smaller threshold value would result in more true positives but also more false positives.

qn) Compute a score for the test graph by taking the maximum distance of any node embedding in the test graph to the centroid of the assigned cluster.

Computing a score for the test graph by taking the maximum distance of any node embedding in the test graph to the centroid of the assigned cluster involves the following steps:

For each node in the test graph, compute its node embedding using the same algorithm as used for the normal graphs.
Assign each node embedding to one of the clusters based on its proximity to the centroids of the clusters.
For each cluster, compute the centroid by taking the average of the node embeddings in the cluster.
For each node embedding in the test graph, compute its distance to the centroid of the assigned cluster using a distance metric such as the Euclidean distance or the cosine distance.
Take the maximum distance of any node embedding in the test graph to the centroid of the assigned cluster as the score for the test graph.
Compare the score to a threshold value. If the score is above the threshold, classify the test graph as anomalous.
For example, suppose we have three clusters and the node embeddings for a test graph are assigned to Cluster 2. The centroid for Cluster 2 is computed as the average of the node embeddings in Cluster 2. For each node embedding in the test graph, we compute its distance to the centroid of Cluster 2 using a distance metric such as the Euclidean distance or the cosine distance. The maximum distance of any node embedding in the test graph to the centroid of Cluster 2 is taken as the score for the test graph. If the score is above a certain threshold, we classify the test graph as anomalous.

____________________________________________________________________________



what are the alternatives for this:

There are several alternatives to taking the maximum distance of any node embedding in the test graph to the centroid of the assigned cluster as the score for the test graph. Some of these alternatives are:
Mean distance: Instead of taking the maximum distance, we can take the mean distance of all node embeddings in the test graph to the centroid of the assigned cluster. This can be useful in cases where the maximum distance is influenced by outliers in the test graph.
Median distance: Similar to mean distance, we can take the median distance of all node embeddings in the test graph to the centroid of the assigned cluster. This can be useful in cases where the distribution of distances is skewed.
Sum of distances: We can also compute the sum of distances of all node embeddings in the test graph to the centroid of the assigned cluster. This can be useful in cases where we want to penalize graphs that have many nodes far away from the centroid of the assigned cluster.
Mahalanobis distance: Instead of using a standard distance metric such as the Euclidean distance or the cosine distance, we can use the Mahalanobis distance which takes into account the covariance of the data. This can be useful in cases where the dimensions of the node embeddings are correlated.
Weighted distance: We can weight the distances of the node embeddings in the test graph based on their importance in the graph. For example, we can weight the distances of the central nodes more heavily than the distances of the peripheral nodes.
The choice of score computation method would depend on the specific application and the characteristics of the graph data being analyzed. It is important to experiment with different score computation methods to determine the best approach for a given problem.

False positive rate vs True positive rate

Finally, the threshold value may need to be manually set and may not be suitable for all types of data.
es, that's correct. Setting the threshold value for anomaly detection in a clustering-based approach can be challenging, as it may depend on various factors such as the quality of the embeddings, the choice of distance metric, and the characteristics of the data.
In some cases, it may be possible to set the threshold value using prior knowledge or domain expertise. For example, if the data is known to have a certain level of noise or variability, we may set a higher threshold to reduce false positives. Alternatively, we may use statistical methods to estimate the threshold value based on the distribution of the scores in the normal data.
However, in many cases, the threshold value may need to be determined empirically through experimentation and fine-tuning. This process can be time-consuming and may require a significant amount of labeled data to evaluate the performance of the anomaly detection method.
In contrast, some other approaches, such as GNN-based anomaly detection methods, do not rely on a fixed threshold value and can adapt to the specific characteristics of the data. These methods can learn a representation of the normal graphs and use it to detect anomalies based on a similarity score or a reconstruction error. The threshold value can then be set dynamically based on the distribution of the scores or errors in the normal data.

Yes, that's right. GNN-based anomaly detection methods can be more adaptive to the specific characteristics of the data and do not require a fixed threshold value for detecting anomalies. Instead, they can learn a representation of the normal graphs and use it to detect anomalies based on a similarity score or a reconstruction error.

For example, in autoencoder-based GNN anomaly detection methods, the GNN is used to encode the input graph into a low-dimensional representation and then decode it back to its original form. The reconstruction error between the input graph and its reconstruction can be used as a measure of the graph's normality. Anomalies can be detected based on a threshold set on the reconstruction error or the deviation of the error from the distribution of errors in the normal data.

Similarly, in graph-based outlier detection methods, such as the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) or the Isolation Forest, the GNN is used to learn a representation of the normal graphs, and the outlier score is computed based on the deviation of the input graph from the learned representation. The threshold value can be set dynamically based on the distribution of the outlier scores in the normal data.

Overall, GNN-based anomaly detection methods can be more adaptive and data-driven than clustering-based approaches, as they can learn a representation of the normal graphs and use it to detect anomalies based on a dynamic threshold. However, these methods may require a significant amount of labeled data for training and may be computationally more expensive than clustering-based approaches.

need to propose novel methodology for subgraph anolmaly detection using gnn. suggest base methods for comparison from 
To propose a novel methodology for subgraph anomaly detection using GNNs, you can start by identifying the key components of your method and the main challenges you want to address. Some of the components to consider include the choice of GNN architecture, the method for extracting subgraphs, and the technique for computing anomaly scores.
Once you've designed your methodology, you should compare its performance against existing methods to demonstrate its effectiveness. Some baseline methods for subgraph anomaly detection and graph anomaly detection that you can use for comparison include:
Graph Autoencoders (GAE) / Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE): Train a GAE or VGAE on the graph and use the learned embeddings to compute anomaly scores. You can either compare subgraphs based on the reconstruction error or perform clustering on the embeddings and detect anomalies as outliers.
Subgraph2Vec / Graph2Vec: These methods learn embeddings for subgraphs and entire graphs, respectively, by converting them into sequences and applying the doc2vec algorithm. After obtaining the embeddings, you can use standard anomaly detection techniques, such as clustering, to identify anomalous subgraphs.
Deep Graph Infomax (DGI): DGI is an unsupervised representation learning method for graphs. It maximizes the mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of graphs. Train DGI on the graph and use the learned embeddings to detect anomalies.
GraphSAGE: GraphSAGE is a GNN architecture that learns how to aggregate features from a node's local neighborhood. Train GraphSAGE on the graph and use the learned embeddings to detect anomalies.
Node2Vec / Edge2Vec: These methods learn embeddings for nodes and edges by performing random walks and applying the Skip-Gram model. After obtaining the embeddings, you can use standard anomaly detection techniques to identify anomalous subgraphs.
Spectral-based methods: Use spectral graph theory to compute graph Laplacian or adjacency matrix eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Analyze these spectral properties to detect anomalies in the graph structure.
When comparing your proposed methodology to these baselines, make sure to use the same dataset and evaluation metrics to ensure a fair comparison. Common evaluation metrics for anomaly detection include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
As you design your novel methodology, remember that you should focus on addressing the specific challenges related to subgraph anomaly detection, such as scalability, interpretability, and performance on diverse datasets.

explain "Assign each node embedding in the test graph to one of the clusters based on its proximity to the centroids of the clusters.
Compute a score for the test graph based on the distance between the test embeddings and the centroids of the assigned clusters."

n the anomaly detection process, after generating node embeddings for the test graph and computing the centroids of the clusters, you need to assign each node embedding in the test graph to one of the clusters and compute a score for the test graph. This is done as follows:
Assign each node embedding in the test graph to one of the clusters based on its proximity to the centroids of the clusters:
For each node embedding in the test graph, calculate the distance to each centroid, and assign the node to the cluster corresponding to the centroid with the smallest distance.
Compute a score for the test graph based on the distance between the test embeddings and the centroids of the assigned clusters:
The score can be calculated in several ways, such as taking the mean or the sum of the distances between the node embeddings and their corresponding cluster centroids. A higher score generally indicates that the test graph is more dissimilar to the normal graphs and could be considered anomalous.
Classify the test graph as anomalous if the score is above a certain threshold:
The threshold value should be determined based on the characteristics of the graph data and the desired sensitivity for detecting anomalies. In practice, this threshold can be set by analyzing the scores obtained from normal graphs and selecting an appropriate value.


question here is do all noed embeddings of test graph will  get assigned to the same cluster or each test  embedding may get assigned to different clusters
Each test node embedding may get assigned to different clusters. When you assign test node embeddings to clusters, you are comparing each individual node in the test graph to the centroids of the clusters created from normal graphs. Each node in the test graph may have different structural properties and relationships with other nodes, which is captured by its embedding.
Thus, it is entirely possible that different test node embeddings are assigned to different clusters, based on the proximity of each embedding to the centroids. The assignment process essentially finds the most similar group (or cluster) for each node in the test graph based on the learned patterns from the normal graphs.


Compute a score for the test graph based on the distance between the test embeddings and the centroids of the assigned clusters: . what exactly is this distance?

The distance mentioned here is a measure of dissimilarity between the test embeddings and the centroids of the assigned clusters. This distance is usually calculated using a distance metric like Euclidean distance or cosine distance.
When you compute a score for the test graph, you're essentially calculating the sum or average of the distances between each test node embedding and the centroid of the cluster it has been assigned to. This score represents how well the node embeddings of the test graph match the structure and properties of the clusters obtained from normal graphs.
A high score (i.e., a large average distance) might indicate that the test graph has different properties from the normal graphs, suggesting that it could be anomalous. Conversely, a low score (i.e., a small average distance) would mean that the test graph is quite similar to the normal graphs and is likely not anomalous. The choice of threshold for determining whether a graph is anomalous would depend on the specific application and characteristics of the graph data.

This program performs the following tasks:
Imports necessary libraries, including PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, and scikit-learn.
Loads the Cora dataset, a citation network dataset often used in graph neural network research.
Defines kmeans_plus_plus and d2_weighted_kmeans_plus_plus functions to initialize the K-means centroids. The kmeans_plus_plus function initializes the first centroid as the data point closest to the mean and others iteratively by randomly selecting data points proportional to the distance from the closest centroid. The d2_weighted_kmeans_plus_plus function does the same but uses the D2-weighting method.
Defines a two-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using the PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric libraries.
Trains the GCN model on the Cora dataset with early stopping, then extracts and normalizes the node embeddings from the trained model.
Computes the initial centroids for K-means clustering using the kmeans_plus_plus function (commented lines indicate alternatives using d2_weighted_kmeans_plus_plus).
Defines the run_clustering function to perform K-means clustering using both the proposed method (centroids from k-means++ or D2-weighted k-means++) and the original method (random initialization). It also computes various clustering evaluation metrics such as SSE, silhouette score, ARI, Calinski-Harabasz score, Davies-Bouldin score, and mutual information score.
Runs the clustering algorithm multiple times (10 in this case) with different centroid initializations, and computes the percentage difference in each metric between the proposed method and the original method.
Finally, the program prints the percentage difference in metrics for each run.
In summary, the program trains a GCN model on the Cora dataset, extracts node embeddings, initializes centroids using k-means++, and performs K-means clustering on the embeddings. It compares the results to a baseline method that initializes centroids randomly and computes the percentage difference in various clustering evaluation metrics.

Here's a suggested novel approach for anomaly scoring:

Compute the distance between each node and its nearest centroid using the Euclidean distance measure.
For each cluster, calculate the average distance of its nodes to their centroid.
Compute the standard deviation of the distances across all nodes in the graph.
For each node, compute its anomaly score as the number of standard deviations its distance to its nearest centroid deviates from the average distance of its centroid's cluster.
Alternatively, instead of using the number of standard deviations as the anomaly score, you can use a normalized distance measure that takes into account the average distance of the centroid's cluster
_________________________________________________________________

For your specific use case, you can consider other criteria to identify anomalies:
Clusters with a very low number of nodes (small subgraphs)
Clusters with high average distance between nodes (based on node embeddings)

which auto encoder to be used?what will be the encoder? can we see this as multimodal ?
When working with graph data, you can use a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) or Graph Variational Autoencoder (VGAE) as the anomaly detection model. Both GAE and VGAE are designed to work with graphs and leverage graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for the encoding process. The main difference is that VGAE incorporates a variational layer in the architecture, enabling the model to learn a continuous latent representation.
For the encoder, you can use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Graph Attention Network (GAT), or GraphSAGE model, depending on your preference and the dataset characteristics. These encoders can capture both the local structure and attributes of the subgraphs.
The hybrid approach of combining traditional graph features and deep learning embeddings can be considered a multimodal approach since you are combining information from different "modes" of representation. Traditional graph features capture global information, while the graph embeddings obtained from deep learning models capture local information.
However, keep in mind that multimodal learning typically refers to the integration of information from different data modalities (e.g., combining text, images, and audio data). In the context of graph data, the term multimodal might be less appropriate, as both traditional graph features and deep learning embeddings are extracted from the same data modality (i.e., the graph). Instead, you might refer to it as a "hybrid" or "integrated" approach, combining different feature extraction methods for the graph data.
__________________________________________________________________________________

Here's how you can modify the anomaly detection process to follow this approach:
Generate node embeddings: Use the provided code to train the GCN model and obtain node embeddings. The normalized_embeddings tensor will contain the embeddings for each node in the graph.
Clustering: Perform clustering using K-means with k-means++ or D2-weighted k-means++ initialization, as provided in the original code snippet. This will create clusters of nodes with similar embeddings.
Create subgraphs: Create subgraphs for each cluster by extracting the induced subgraph for the set of nodes in each cluster.
# Create subgraphs for each cluster
subgraphs = []
for cluster_label in range(n_clusters):
    cluster_indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(proposed_kmeans.labels_) if x == cluster_label]
    subgraph = G.subgraph(cluster_indices)
    subgraphs.append(subgraph)
Anomaly detection: Perform anomaly detection on the subgraphs as described in the previous answer. Train an anomaly detection model like an autoencoder, one-class SVM, or isolation forest on the clustered embeddings to detect unusual subgraph structures or patterns.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the anomaly detection model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
This approach allows you to focus on identifying anomalous subgraphs based on the clustering of node embeddings instead of predefined subgraph extraction methods. Note that you may need to adjust the provided code snippets to fit into your existing codebase.


didnt get step 3 . consider these two techniques for finding anomalies "or your specific use case, you can consider other criteria to identify anomalies:
Clusters with a very low number of nodes (small subgraphs)
Clusters with high average distance between nodes (based on node embeddings)
". how about finding anomalies from attributes point of view and graph point of view and  then combine these two to call it is as multinmodality.

I apologize for the confusion regarding step 3. You can use the two techniques for finding anomalies that you mentioned, focusing on both attribute-based anomalies and graph structure-based anomalies, and then combine them to create a multimodal anomaly detection approach. Here's an outline of the process:
Generate node embeddings and cluster them: Follow the previous steps to generate node embeddings using the GCN model, and perform clustering on the embeddings.
Attribute-based anomaly detection: Detect anomalies in the node embeddings by examining clusters with unusual properties. You can use the techniques mentioned in your question:
a. Clusters with a very low number of nodes: These clusters might represent unusual patterns or substructures in the graph that are different from the majority of the graph.
b. Clusters with high average distance between nodes (based on node embeddings): These clusters might indicate that the nodes within the cluster are less similar to each other and could represent potential anomalies.
Graph structure-based anomaly detection: Use the clusters to create subgraphs, and then detect anomalies in these subgraphs based on their structural properties, such as:
a. Unusually high or low density of connections (edges) within the subgraph.
b. Unusual motifs or graph patterns that deviate from the majority of subgraphs.
Combine attribute-based and graph structure-based anomalies: To create a multimodal anomaly detection approach, combine the results of attribute-based and graph structure-based anomaly detection. You can use a weighted approach to combine the scores from both methods, where the weights can be adjusted depending on the importance of each modality.
# Example of combining anomaly scores using a weighted approach
attribute_weight = 0.5
structure_weight = 0.5

combined_anomaly_scores = attribute_weight * attribute_anomaly_scores + structure_weight * structure_anomaly_scores


Evaluate the performance: Evaluate the performance of the multimodal anomaly detection model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
By using a multimodal approach, you will be able to identify anomalies that may be missed by examining either attributes or graph structures alone. This can provide a more comprehensive view of potential anomalies in your graph data.
difference between step 2 and 3 ? what does it mean by "use clusters to create subgraphs"
Apologies for any confusion. I will clarify the difference between steps 2 and 3 and explain what "use clusters to create subgraphs" means.
Step 2 (Attribute-based anomaly detection): This step involves examining the clusters of node embeddings based on their attribute values, such as clusters with very low numbers of nodes or high average distances between nodes. These clusters might be considered anomalous based on the attribute values.
Step 3 (Graph structure-based anomaly detection): This step focuses on the actual structure of the graph, such as the connections between nodes and the density of edges within the subgraphs. The aim is to detect anomalies based on the structure of the subgraphs rather than their attribute values.
To "use clusters to create subgraphs," you first obtain the clusters from the clustering algorithm applied to the node embeddings. These clusters represent groups of nodes with similar properties in the feature space. You can then create subgraphs by extracting the nodes that belong to each cluster and their corresponding connections (edges) in the original graph.
For example, if you have a cluster with nodes A, B, and C, you can create a subgraph by extracting these three nodes and their connections (if any) from the original graph. This way, you will have subgraphs that correspond to the clusters you have found using the node embeddings.
Once you have these subgraphs, you can analyze their structural properties, such as the density of connections or the presence of unusual graph patterns, to identify anomalies in the graph structure. This is different from attribute-based anomaly detection, where you analyze the attribute values of the node embeddings rather than the structure of the graph.
_______________________________




Yes, your approach can be considered as a form of multi-modality since you are using two different types of information (graph structure and node attributes) to detect anomalies.
In this approach, you would use two different encoders:
A graph-based encoder (e.g., Graph Convolutional Network, GraphSAGE, or GAT) to generate node embeddings that capture the graph structure information. You would then perform clustering and anomaly detection using these embeddings.
An attribute-based encoder (e.g., a simple neural network or another suitable method) to generate attribute embeddings that capture the attribute information of the nodes. You would then perform clustering and anomaly detection using these embeddings.
After performing anomaly detection separately on both the graph-based and attribute-based embeddings, you can combine the results to find a more comprehensive set of anomalies. You can do this by finding the intersection of anomalies detected in both methods or using a technique such as weighted averaging to give more importance to one type of anomaly over another.
This approach can potentially provide better anomaly detection performance since it utilizes information from both the graph structure and node attributes, making it more robust and less prone to missing any anomalies that might be present in the data.

Finally, the performance of the multimodal anomaly detection model is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

How many thresholds need to be set?

Based on the conversation so far, there are three main thresholds that need to be set:
threshold_low_nodes: This threshold is used to filter out very small subgraphs that might not be considered meaningful for further analysis. It determines the minimum number of nodes a subgraph should have to be considered significant.
threshold_high_avg_distance: This threshold is used to filter out subgraphs with high average distances between nodes. High average distances might indicate sparseness or lack of cohesion within the subgraph.
threshold_low_density and threshold_high_density: These thresholds are used to filter out subgraphs with very low or very high graph densities. Low-density subgraphs may represent sparse, disconnected structures, while high-density subgraphs might represent overly connected or even cliquish structures.
Keep in mind that the specific thresholds you choose will depend on the characteristics of your dataset and your goals for analysis. The percentile-based approach I suggested earlier is one way to set these thresholds, but you might need to experiment with different values to get the desired results for your use case.

Novelty:
Yes, there are several novel aspects to this code.
First, it uses graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) to learn node embeddings on the Cora dataset. This is a popular benchmark dataset in the field of graph representation learning.
Second, it proposes a modification to the k-means clustering algorithm called D2-weighted k-means++, which is used to cluster the learned node embeddings. This modification takes into account the distances to the closest existing centroid when selecting the next centroid, and has been shown to outperform the original k-means algorithm in some cases.
Third, it uses a combination of attribute-based and graph structure-based anomaly detection methods to identify anomalous clusters in the graph. This is a useful approach for identifying subgraphs that deviate from the norm in terms of their structural and attribute properties.

combined_copy.py 
The code you provided trains a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) on the Cora dataset and then performs clustering on the learned node embeddings. Specifically, it loads the Cora dataset using Planetoid from torch_geometric.datasets, replaces all labels other than 3 with 1, and defines a GCN model with 2 output classes. It then trains the GCN model on the dataset and obtains the learned node embeddings using the last layer of the model. Next, it performs clustering on the embeddings using k-means with k=7. It extracts subgraphs for each cluster and calculates the subgraph representations using the subgraph_representation function. Finally, it stores the subgraph representations in a list called subgraph_representations
